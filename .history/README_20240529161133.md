# sucorn
pronounced as [su-kon](https://fubuki.moe/mascots.html)

A project to automate the creation of AI generated images using Dall-E 3 hosted on Bing Image Creator, and to classify which ones are good and which ones are bad, so that time spent during the ML/DL life cycle is reduced
The goals of this project include

- **deprecated** automatic collection of images using `pyautogui`,
- automatic collection of images through the [BingImageCreator reverse-engineered API](https://github.com/acheong08/BingImageCreator/tree/main)
- **WIP** automatic collection of images through [stable diffusion's](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion) text2img, hopefully with automatic parameter tuning
- Automatic collection of Microsoft Session cookies using `WebDriver`
- Displaying these images on Discord for remote labelling
- Labelling these images from both remote (Discord) and local (tkinter) for training
- Using Discord for easy, persistent remote access of images
- use [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) and [matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/) for displaying statistics locally and on Discord
- **WIP** training of Keras classifier
- **WIP** training of Stable Diffusion LoRA (LoRA not included in this repo)

# Setup
> [!WARNING]
> There is no .exe file because I am a [stupid smelly nerd](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock/issues/2011)

It is recommended that a venv is used as there are a lot of dependencies (50>)
